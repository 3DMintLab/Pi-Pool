# Pi Pool

Pi Pool is a Cardano Stakepool on Raspberry Pi. Check out my <a href="http://pi-pool.web.app" target="_blank">website</a> to see more about my stakepool. You can support me by just delegating to my pool. I'm definitely around at mainnet release of Shelley.<br>
This repository is a guide to setup a stakepool on a Raspberry Pi by your own. The goal of this repository is to make it as easy as possible to run a Cardano-Node on Raspberry Pi.

## Prerequesits

* Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 GB or 8 GB (recommended) RAM
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Very easy to install with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Pi Imager</a>)
